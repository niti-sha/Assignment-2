9.	Program To Find Area In Python
10.	Program To Reverse A List 
11.	Program to find  sum of all elements in list
12.	Find average, max, min  of list elements
13.	Write a Python program to create a dictionary grouping a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary of lists.
a.	Original list:
[('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
Grouping a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary of lists:
{'yellow': [1, 3], 'blue': [2, 4], 'red': [1]}
14.	Write a Python program to convert more than one list to nested dictionary. 
a.	Original strings:
['S001', 'S002', 'S003', 'S004']
['Adina Park', 'Leyton Marsh', 'Duncan Boyle', 'Saim Richards']
[85, 98, 89, 92]
Nested dictionary:[{'S001': {'Adina Park': 85}}, {'S002': {'Leyton Marsh': 98}}, {'S003': {'Duncan Boyle': 89}}, {'S004': {'Saim Richards': 92}}]
15.	Python program to check if a set is a subset of another set.
16.	Write a Python program to create a symmetric difference and set difference
17.	Write a Python program to remove an empty tuple(s) from a list of tuples.
a.	Sample data: [(), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
Expected output: [('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), 'd']
18.	Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples.
a.	Original Tuple:
((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))
Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples:
[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
19.	Write a Python program to check the validity of a password (input from users).

Validation :
At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
At least 1 number between [0-9].
At least 1 character from [$#@].
Minimum length 6 characters.
Maximum length 16 characters.
